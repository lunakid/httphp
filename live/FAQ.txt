* Why not just using PHP5's new built-in server?

I'd love to, but stopping and restarting it every time I want to serve 
some other dir is a nuisance.


---------------------------------
* Why not node-php? 

Quoting https://github.com/davidcoallier/node-php:

"Installing

Well this is a bit tricky, there are a few things you will need in order to get this thang running:

You need a running PHP-FPM server.
You need to have Node.js installed with NPM
Install node-fastcgi-parser ( https://github.com/billywhizz/node-fastcgi-parser )
Then you git clone git://github.com/davidcoallier/node-php.git, 
then you git submodule init, then you git submodule update, and npm install
...
There is no POST handling. I'm not that far in the FCGI specs yet — need to find how to send data (post data)
There is no base url. If you include ../../../../poop it will try to load it and most likely will fail.
If you try to load a file that the PHP-FPM worker does not have access to, it will fail silently and you will swear. 
A lot. By silently I mean, it will give you a 404 even though the files do exist."


---------------------------------
* Why not node-php? 

It just didn't work as-is. But that's exactly the module I tweaked for my needs.
So, thanks for the kick-start to the author of 'php-cgi' ("sihorton")!
