TODO:
=====

+ -a for "attach as alias" (regexp)
+ File-type handlers (move PHP to php-handler, add js etc.).
+ Support for regular "ctrl:" request handling. 
+ Better STOP request handling: add some security token?
  (Since this is meant to be a local-only server, no need to complicate things that far!)


DONE:
=====
[REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE VERSION IN THE SOURCE, TOO!]

2014-03-08 - v1
+ Changed the startup scripts and the docs.
+ Restructured for better instant deployment (The "live" dir is now "officially"
  the deliverable package.)
+ Added -h for help.
+ Tagged as version 1.

2014-02-05
+ Minor changes to some error logs.

2014-02-05 - v0.3
+ Rudimentary "reconfiguration" (basically port-reclaiming) protocol added, via 
  a "?ctrl:stop!" query string.
  If a new server (NEW) is launched but it detects another instance (OLD) already 
  running on the same port, it then tries to tell the OLD one to shut down so 
  that the NEW one can take over.
+ Small improvements here and there.
+ SCRIPT_FILENAME (regression) fixed.

2014-02-04
+ FIX SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO, PHP_SELF. (PATH_INFO currently unsupported;
  always empty.)
+ Command line support for webdir and port.
+ Support for implicit index file list.
+ Set 'REQUEST_URI' in the CGI env.
+ Set 'SERVER_PORT' and 'SERVER_NAME' (to what's in the request!) in the CGI env.

2014-02-03
