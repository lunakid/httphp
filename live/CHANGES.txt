! Use the HTTP status phrase set by CGI, instead of ignoring it and using
  the Node.js defaults.
  
! Return the error pages as text/html, rather than plain text.

! Add option to ignore the pre-packaged node.exe for those who have their own.
! Fix: "owered-By: PHP/5.5.11-2tent-type: text/htmlript> location="README.txt" </script>"
  on Linux. Just running in this live dir, and opening http://localhost:88.
  -> ONLY OCCURED ONCE, after freshly apt-updating php-cgi & nodejs, and the
    first php-cgi invokation from httphp since the last Debian reboot.

! [add-alias-dir] -a for "add alias dir" (with regexp support, later)
    Also add the corresponding "ctrl:" command (generalize out the "control commander",
    like apachectl!)
    ! General form: '[-a[ ["]dirname[=urlrootpath["]]]]'
    ! Multiple -a options supported.
    ! '-a' alone means '-a .=`dirname(realpath(.))`'
! File-type handlers (move PHP to php-handler, add js etc.).
! Check cookies & PHP sessions.
! Better 'CTRL:' request handling: add some security token?
  (Since this is meant to be local-only, no need to complicate things too far!)
! FIX backslashes in SCRIPT_NAME, PHP_SELF etc. 
  Seems wrong only for files directly in SERVER_DOC_ROOT (but not in subdirs).
  See e.g. the prj browser at P:\)
! Add a nice replaceable autoindex PHP module! (Design a general PHP addon module
  interface for that! (Preferably just some drop-in dir.))

DONE:
=====
2014-05-27 - 1.15
+ Change cfg. option INDEXES to INDEX. (Basically to make ON_404_TRY_INDEX 
  more intuitive, at the expense of INDEX becoming less so a bit - but that'd 
  need less explanation, too.)
+ Fix broken HTTP header processing from the CGI stream.
+ Fix broken HTTP response codes set by the CGI program.

2014-04-30
+ Fix httphp.sh to find itself also via symlinked paths.

2014-04-18 - 1.14
+ Log the original request URI before talking about file lookup and mappings!

2014-04-13 - 1.13
+ Moved cfg. to separate file (default.cfg).
+ Moved SERVER_XXX props into SERVER_CFG.XXX.
+ Added SERVER_CFG.ON_404_TRY_INDEX = true/false/"filename"

2014-04-12 - 1.12
+ Replace PHP5ts.dll with a vanilla PHP5.dll (currently 5.4.26).
+ Improved the docs.

2014-04-12 - 1.11
+ Log graceful shutdown (exit(), SIGINT, SIGTERM etc.).

2014-04-12 - 1.10
+ Some files dos2unixed.
+ Fix: Silent exit on bind EACCES (e.g. trying to bind to a port under 1000
  on Linux). Also add catch-all error reporting for unknown cases.

2014-04-9 - 1.09
+ "No PHP support" is logged too early, before the "Server started" line. 
  (In fact the server started message is too late!)
  -> Uhh-ohh, that's because missing PHP support is detected in the startup 
   shell script (on Windows), not by the server itself!...
   * Changed "HTTPHP" prefix to "HTTPHP.cmd".

2014-04-02 - 1.08
+ Added logic to HTTPHP.cmd for locating a PHP-CGI .exe to use (on Windows).
+ Added index.php to the live dir (index.html redirects to that index.php, 
  which redirects to README.txt, basically as a "secret" PHP test at startup.)

2014-04-02 - 1.07
+ Sigh, finally gave in and "officially" integrated the minimal Windows PHP 
  example crap lurking around the rest of the package from the beginning.
  (Just to make it a self-containing survival kit for people not having a PHP 
  installation yet. The dir layout is still pretty lame, it's just hanging 
  in the air, making it slightly problematic for some people to "install", 
  I guess. Well, I've got this gift of making enemies, what can I do?)

2014-03-31 - 1.06
+ [php-multislash-internals]
  PHP internal ?=PHPxxx URIs used to fail with surplus slashes (like //index.php).
  See also [url.parse-crash].
  + Check if this is the same for other servers, too!
  -> No, LAMP is fine; Apache normalizes the slashes in PHP_SELF & SCRIPT_NAME
    (which may be the key!), so now I also do the same.

+ [url.parse-crash]
  Crash when double slashes in the URL: localhost// (or localhost//index.html).
  (Curiously, it does *NOT* crash for localhost/// or localhost/.)
  httphp.js:194
  r reqpath = decodeURIComponent(Url.parse(reqpath, false, true).path.replace(/\
                                                                    ^

  (Note: seems to be related to [php-multislash-internals], too.)
  
  -> It was ultimately caused by Path.extname("//path/file.ext") returning
    nothing (https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/7386).

+ Docs. updated preparing for [add-alias-dir].
+ Minor code improvements.

2014-03-15 - 1.05 [Incorrect version tag on GitHub!]
+ FIX handling urlencoded URLs (i.e. filenames with spaces). 
  (There was no decoding at all).
+ FIX log_debug was silent despite not filtering.
+ Added log filtering for notices and warnings, too.

2014-03-11 - 1.04
+ Remove DEBUG messages from the log by default.

2014-03-11 - 1.03
+ Extended the index file lookup list (notably with README.md and README.txt).
+ [cgi-ok-error] Handle error "OK" in cgi exec... 
  Yes, that "error" did happen on me, causing this exception:
  [1394546261311] GET /changes?db=xxx [mapped to: changes\index.php] - 200 (via PHP-CGI)
  CGI: 'OK' while trying to launch CGI executable 'php-cgi'.

	    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:795:12)

2014-03-11 - 1.02
+ Index lookup log changed to DEBUG.
+ Slightly refined startup logging.
+ Report version and location of the server in the startup message.
+ Added (and using) log*() functions (with a raw timestamp).

2014-03-11 - 1.01
+ Added proper MIME types for the most common file types (suffixes).
+ Moved the in-source change history here. (Some TODOs still left there.)

2014-03-10
+ FIX: CGI "cannot launch CGI executable!" leaves the request hanging.
+ Added 500 error response body messages.
+ Removed "testweb" from under the "live" dir (and added to .gitignore).

2014-03-08 - 1.0
+ Changed the startup scripts and the docs.
+ Restructured for better instant deployment (The "live" dir is now "officially"
  the deliverable package.)
+ Added -h for help.
+ Tagged as version 1.
+ GIT'ed locally.

2014-02-10
* Some preparions to add an URI->dir map (generalized, not just "alias"?).

2014-02-05
+ Minor changes to some error logs.

2014-02-05 - 0.3
+ Rudimentary "reconfiguration" (basically port-reclaiming) protocol added, via 
  a "?ctrl:stop!" query string.
  If a new server (NEW) is launched but it detects another instance (OLD) already 
  running on the same port, it then tries to tell the OLD one to shut down so 
  that the NEW one can take over.
+ Small improvements here and there.
+ SCRIPT_FILENAME (regression) fixed.

2014-02-04
+ FIX SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO, PHP_SELF. (PATH_INFO currently unsupported;
  always empty.)
+ Command line support for webdir and port.
+ Make SERVER_INDEX_FILES a list.
+ Set 'REQUEST_URI' in the CGI env.
+ Set 'SERVER_PORT' and 'SERVER_NAME' (to what's in the request!) in the CGI env.
+ Check for existing DOC_ROOT.
+ php-cgi-sz.js moved to ./lib.

2014-02-03
+ Rudimentary command-line support for changing SERVER_DOC_ROOT.
+ POST support: seems to just work fine as is (via PHP, too).
+ Moved php-cgi (as php-cgi-sz) here from the Node repo.
+ Force text/html for .html and .htm extensions. (Chrome would see them 
	as /plain, unless they start with "<" or something like that.)
+ Fix extension checking: use the local file, not the request.
+ collapse multiple '/' slashes in the req.
+ 500 EISDIR error on requesting dirs
+ Add php-cgi
+ Fix php-cgi (see there!)
+ HTTP logging
+ Basic SERVER_... cfg. vars (port, webdir, index-file)

2014-02-03
* Tested on Linux with PHP-CGI 5.5.0RC1
* Added start shell script for Linux.

2014-02-02
* Works on Windows, with PHP-CGI 5.4.14.
