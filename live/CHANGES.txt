TODO:
=====

+ -a for "attach as alias" (regexp)
+ File-type handlers (move PHP to php-handler, add js etc.).
+ Support for regular "ctrl:" request handling. 
+ Better STOP request handling: add some security token?
  (Since this is meant to be a local-only server, no need to complicate things that far!)


DONE:
=====
[REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE VERSION IN THE SOURCE, TOO!]

2014-03-11 - v1.04
+ Remove DEBUG messages from the log by default.

2014-03-11 - v1.03
+ Extended the index file lookup list (notably with README.md and README.txt).
+ [cgi-ok-error] Handle error "OK" in cgi exec... 
  Yes, that "error" did happen on me, causing this exception:
  [1394546261311] GET /changes?db=xxx [mapped to: changes\index.php] - 200 (via PHP-CGI)
  CGI: 'OK' while trying to launch CGI executable 'php-cgi'.

  http.js:733
	    throw new Error('Can\'t render headers after they are sent to the client.'
	          ^
  Error: Can't render headers after they are sent to the client.

2014-03-11 - v1.02
+ Index lookup log changed to DEBUG.
+ Slightly refined startup logging.
+ Report version and location of the server in the startup message.
+ Added (and using) log*() functions (with a raw timestamp).

2014-03-11 - v1.01
+ Added proper MIME types for the most common file types (suffixes).
+ Moved the in-source change history here. (Some TODOs still left there.)

2014-03-10
+ FIX: CGI "cannot launch CGI executable!" leaves the request hanging.
+ Added 500 error response body messages.
+ Removed "testweb" from under the "live" dir (and added to .gitignore).

2014-03-08 - v1
+ Changed the startup scripts and the docs.
+ Restructured for better instant deployment (The "live" dir is now "officially"
  the deliverable package.)
+ Added -h for help.
+ Tagged as version 1.
+ GIT'ed locally.

2014-02-10
* Some preparions to add an URI->dir map (generalized, not just "alias"?).

2014-02-05
+ Minor changes to some error logs.

2014-02-05 - v0.3
+ Rudimentary "reconfiguration" (basically port-reclaiming) protocol added, via 
  a "?ctrl:stop!" query string.
  If a new server (NEW) is launched but it detects another instance (OLD) already 
  running on the same port, it then tries to tell the OLD one to shut down so 
  that the NEW one can take over.
+ Small improvements here and there.
+ SCRIPT_FILENAME (regression) fixed.

2014-02-04
+ FIX SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO, PHP_SELF. (PATH_INFO currently unsupported;
  always empty.)
+ Command line support for webdir and port.
+ Make SERVER_INDEX_FILES a list.
+ Set 'REQUEST_URI' in the CGI env.
+ Set 'SERVER_PORT' and 'SERVER_NAME' (to what's in the request!) in the CGI env.
+ Check for existing DOC_ROOT.
+ php-cgi-sz.js moved to ./lib.

2014-02-03
+ Rudimentary command-line support for changing SERVER_DOC_ROOT.
+ POST support: seems to just work fine as is (via PHP, too).
+ Moved php-cgi (as php-cgi-sz) here from the Node repo.
+ Force text/html for .html and .htm extensions. (Chrome would see them 
	as /plain, unless they start with "<" or something like that.)
+ Fix extension checking: use the local file, not the request.
+ collapse multiple '/' slashes in the req.
+ 500 EISDIR error on requesting dirs
+ Add php-cgi
+ Fix php-cgi (see there!)
+ HTTP logging
+ Basic SERVER_... cfg. vars (port, webdir, index-file)

2014-02-03
* Tested on Linux with PHP-CGI 5.5.0RC1
* Added start shell script for Linux.

2014-02-02
* Works on Windows, with PHP-CGI 5.4.14.
