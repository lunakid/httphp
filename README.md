Please see [live/README.txt](live/README.txt).<br>

BTW, "live" is just the deliverable working ("portable") server dir,
the only one you actually need from this package.

If you *don't* yet have a working PHP installation on the PATH:

- Linux: just do install the "php5-cgi" package, that should be the
  least painful way.

- Windows XP or above: just (download and) keep the "php" dir, too.
  (If you move it from the default location, change `set PHPDIR=...`
  in `httphp.cmd` accordingly. (Again, see [live/README.txt](live/README.txt)
  for more details.)
