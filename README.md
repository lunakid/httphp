BTW, "live" is just the deliverable working ("portable") server dir,
the only one you actually need from this package.

If you *don't* yet have a working PHP installation on the PATH:

- Linux: just do install the "php5-cgi" package, that should be the 
  painless way.

- Windows XP or above: just keep also the "php" dir here around. 
  (If you move from this default location, change `set PHPDIR=...` 
  in `httphp.cmd` accordingly.)
