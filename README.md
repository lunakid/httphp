Please see [live/README.txt](live/README.txt).<br>

BTW, "live" is just the working deliverable ("portable") server dir,
the only one you need from this package.

If you *don't* yet have a working PHP installation on the PATH 
(on Windows), keep also the "php" dir. (And, if you put it to some 
place other than the default, you may need to change `set PHPDIR=...`
in `live/httphp.cmd` accordingly.)
