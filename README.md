Please see [live/README.txt](live/README.txt).<br>

BTW, "live" is just the working deliverable ("portable") server dir,
the only one you need from this package.

If you *don't* yet have a working PHP installation on the PATH (on 
Windows), keep also the "php" dir, too. (And, if you put it to some
place other than the default, you may need to change a line in 
`live/httphp.cmd` accordingly.)
